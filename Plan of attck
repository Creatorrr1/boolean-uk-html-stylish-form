Milestones:
1. add main sections
2. Complete the HTML first before you move on to CSS
3. implement center wrapper and use border to visualise it
4. Use min-height and max-height and maybe fixed height
5. Add CSS styling and finish it off with the background.


PROCESS
1. implement each milestone one by one
2. do not move onto the next milestone until the previous is completed
3. if you're stuck for more than 20 minutes without making progress, then that's when we jump into a support call (ticket)
4. if you are spending a long time on a section, but are making progress, that's good
5. use simple elements (a div that has a border and fixed size, to SIMULATE a specific component

FOCUS
1. Focus on one thing at a time
